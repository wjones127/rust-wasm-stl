# rust-wasm-stl

:construction: This project is a WIP.

This is an interactive demo of the STL (“Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess”) decomposition function.

This is a proof-of-concept implementation showing how to implement statistical models in a very portable way by combining:

 * Apache Arrow
 * Rust
 * WASM / WASI
